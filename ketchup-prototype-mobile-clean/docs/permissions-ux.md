# Permissions UX

## Contacts Permission Denied (Blocked State)
**Headline:** Contacts access is off

**Body copy:** To show your contacts here, enable access in your device settings. We only use your contacts to build your list and never store them without your approval.

**CTA:** Go to Settings

**Return without permission:** If the user comes back without granting contacts access, keep the picker locked and show the same blocked state. The minimum-selection gate stays active (e.g., “Select at least 3 contacts to continue”) and progress remains disabled until permission is granted and the minimum selection is met.
